# Correction

In the assignment, the instructor tell us to create a 'dom-api' functionality using 'theSportsDb' api. But unfortunately, 'thesportsdb' website is not avaiable now. I tell that things to the phitron's support team. They suggest me to use another api library like 'MeadDb'. So, I used that.
